## Overview

This is a simple landing I did to practice my HTML / CSS skills.

An open source mockup was used, which only had two resolution options, so I had to make sure the page transitions smoothly between the breakpoints and looks good on all screens.

I also tried to stick to BEM methodology naming and added some simple onscroll animation.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
